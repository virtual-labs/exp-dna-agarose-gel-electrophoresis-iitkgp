### About the Experiment 

Agarose gel electrophoresis is used to resolve DNA fragments on the basis of their molecular weight on an agarose gel. The smaller sized fragments migrate faster than larger ones; the distance migrated on the gel varies inversely with the logarithm of the molecular weight. In this experiment, we have three main objectives listed as follows:
1. Preparation of an agarose gel
2. Running an agarose gel 
3. Visualization of DNA
