## Objective 

Agarose gel electrophoresis is used to resolve DNA fragments on the basis of their molecular weight on an agarose gel. The smaller-sized fragments migrate faster than larger ones; the distance migrated on the gel varies inversely with the logarithm of the molecular weight. In this experiment, we have three main objectives listed as follows:
1. Preparation of an agarose gel
2. Running an agarose gel 
3. Visualization of DNA
